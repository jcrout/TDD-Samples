scenario base: http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/560137/NET-TDD-Test-Driven-Development-by-example-Part 

My objective is to write a component that can convert from numbers to their roman numeral representations. The one constraint proposed is that values must be between 1 and 3000.

I will use that scenario as a starting point, and then I will write my tests first without checking how the author of this article wrote his tests until I have finished the production code. I will continue to update this repository as I go along.
